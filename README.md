# DungeonQuest

🧊 Project Codename: DungeonQuest
Welcome to DungeonQuest — a tactical, turn-based RPG that combines strategic tile movement, a card-based combat system, and elemental powers to create a dynamic battle experience.

🎮 Gameplay Overview
DungeonQuest is a grid-based tactical RPG with an isometric perspective. Players choose an elemental affinity and build a custom deck of ability cards to battle through dungeons filled with enemies, puzzles, and boss fights.

⚔️ Key Features
🔁 Exploration
Tile-Based Movement: Classic grid-style navigation for precise tactical positioning.

Isometric View: Locked isometric camera with potential for slight movement enhancements.

Interaction: Players press a button to interact with objects for greater control.

Area Progression: Unlock new zones via key items, defeating bosses, and solving optional puzzles.

🧠 Combat System
Turn Order: Determined by a dice roll for simplicity and randomness.

Action System: One action per turn — either move or attack.

Grid Movement: Tile-to-tile movement with possible obstacles blocking line-of-sight.

Elemental Damage: Terrain and environment affect card damage and status effects.

🃏 Card Mechanics
Deck System: Players can hold up to 6 cards at a time, with a total of 24 available per element.

Acquisition: Cards are discovered through exploration and victories.

Element Choice: Players choose an elemental path at the start (Fire, Water, etc.).

Rarity & Progression: Cards vary in rarity and can be found, earned, or (potentially) bought.

🏰 Level & Encounter Design
Dungeon Structure: Likely linear for now, but flexible for future semi-random design.

Combat Zones: Battles begin when players enter specific trigger tiles.

🔄 Progression
No Character Leveling: Progression is tied to card collection and deck building.

Power-Ups: Additional enhancements might be added for variety.

Enemy Scaling: TBD — potential for enemy scaling depending on testing.

🧩 UI/UX Design
HUD Elements: Health, available cards, and movement indicators.

Battle UI: Visual indicators for attack ranges and enemy turns.

Deck Management: Players can view and manage their card decks between fights.

🌍 Environmental Effects
Elemental Terrain: The environment affects card effectiveness (e.g., fire cards are stronger in lava zones).

Interactive Tiles: Some terrain may impact movement or block attacks.

Hazards: Minimal environmental hazards for now — may expand later.

🚧 Current Status
This game is in early development and all features are subject to change. We’re currently focusing on prototyping grid movement, combat, and card interactions.
